The creative direction behind the home page is centred around Satsuma's logo, an orange dot. This is represented with a ping pong ball acting as the device of cause and effect for the brand. Three still life concepts were produced as feature images.

Satsuma is a Sydney based design agency. The purpose of the website is to showcase Satsuma's portfolio of work including case studies.
