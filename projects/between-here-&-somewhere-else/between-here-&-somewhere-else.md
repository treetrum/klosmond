Between Here & Somewhere Else is a collage designed for Our Hands Zine, a quarterly university based publication that explores different illustrative techniques each issue.

Created with original and sourced images from publications Monster Children, Yen and Catalogue. The four-page collage explores the notion of being in one place, time or stage in life and the progression into the next. The next place, time or stage - the somewhere else.
