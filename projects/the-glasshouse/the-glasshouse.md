The Glasshouse is a hypothetical caf√© and bar. As a personal brief I designed the outcome to be centred around botanicals and elements reflecting the geometric structure of a glasshouse's framework. Typography places a key roll in introducing a contemporary look and feel.

Elements designed are based around the grand opening of the cafe including collateral such as menus, business cards and take away coffee cups.
